General Rules:

Rule #1 //When nothing happens, move forward
If True Then
	Perform(MoveForwardPlan(10))
End

Rule #2 //When a wall or robot is detected, avoid it
If Observed(DistanceUpperSonar < 10) And (DepositAtWall, False) Then
	Perform(TurnPlan)
End

Rule #3 //When a cluster is detected, avoid it leaving all blocks in the cluster
If Observed(SensorPress, True) And (DepositAtWall, False) Then
	Perform(DropBlockPlan)
	Belief(Collecting, False)
	Belief(Searching, True)
End

Rule #4 //When a light object is collected, start searching for other blocks to form a cluster
If Belief(Collecting, True) And Observed(LightSensor(LightObject)) And Observed(SensorPress, False) Then
	Belief(Collecting, False)
	Belief(DepositAtWall, False)
	Belief(locationScanned, False) //Since it just collected a block it should scan the current area again.
	Belief(Searching, True)
End

Rule #5 //When a dark object is collected, start moving it toward a wall
If Belief(Collecting, True) And Observed(LightSensor(DarkObject)) And Observed(SensorPress, False) Then
	Belief(Collecting, False)
	Belief(Searching, False)
	Belief(DepositAtWall, True)
End

Rules While Searching:

Rule #6 //If the agent is searching for a block and it did not scan the current arrea yet then scan this area.
If Belief(Searching, True) And Belief(locationScanned, False) Then
	Perform(ScanPlan) //Creates closestBlockAngle and closestblockDistance if succesfull
	Belief(locationScanned, True)
	Belief(TravelDistanceLastScan(getTravelDistance))
End

Rule #7 //If the agent found a block at a certain angle but was still searching then it starts collecting
If Belief(Searching, True) And Belief(closestBlockAngle, Angle) Then
	Perform(TurnToPlan(Angle))
	Belief(Searching, False)
	Belief(locationScanned, False)
	Belief(Collecting, True)
	Belief(DistanceToObject(getClosestblockDistance), True)
End

Rule #8 //After traveling some distance you no longer belief that you scanned the current area
If Belief(Searching, True) And Belief(TravelDistanceLastScan(Distance)) And (getTravelDistance - Distance > 50) Then
	Belief(locationScanned, False)
End

Rule #9 //In other modes the fact that a location is scanned is meaningless. If it gets back to searching it should always start scanning the current arrea.
If Belief(Searching, False) And Belief(locationScanned, True) Then
	Belief(locationScanned, False)
End

Rules While Collecting:

Rule #10 //If the agent is collecting a block, update the belief about its distance
If Belief(Collecting, True) And Belief(DistanceToObject(Distance)) Then
	Perform(DriveForwardPlan(10))
	Drop Belief(DistanceToObject(Distance))
	Belief(DistanceToObject(Distance - 10))
End

Rule #11 //If driving for more then the distance you belief the block is away and you did not collect a block then you start searching again.
If Belief(Collecting, True) And Belief(DistanceToObject(Distance)) And Distance < -10 Then
	Drop Belief(DistanceToObject(Distance))
	Belief(Collecting, False)
	Belief(Searching, True)
End

Rules While Depositing At A Wall:

Rule #12 //If a cluster is detected then try to move away with the block
If Belief(DepositAtWall, True) And Observed(SensorPress, True) Then
	Perform(TurnPlan)
End

Rule #13 //If a wall is detected then drop the block
If Belief(DepositAtWall, True) And Observed(DistanceUpperSonar < 10) Then
	Perform(DropBlockPlan)
	Belief(DepositAtWall, False)
	Belief(Searching, True)
End

Plans:

DropBlockPlan(
	Perform(DriveBackwardPlan(20))
	Perform(TurnPlan)
)
